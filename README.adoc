= Fabric8 Docker Images
:toc: macro

toc::[]

https://fabric8.io[Fabric8] is a mircoservices platform on top of
Kubernetes and OpenShift. It includes also a set of Docker images for
creating Microservices but which are also usable as general Docker base
images. This document gives an overview of all images available.

These images came as _families_, whose members are slight variations with different flavors. E.g. the https://github.com/fabric8io-images/java[Java] base image has variants based on CentOS, Alpine or `jboss/base-jdk` for Java 7 and 8 with including the full JDK or only the JRE. These families are created from templates with the help of https://github.com/fabric8io-images/fish-pepper[fish-pepper], a templating engine for Docker builds. Each image family shares the same release cycle (i.e. the version) and are available from index.docker.io.

All images share some common characteristics as they include shared fish-pepper _blocks_:

* https://github.com/fabric8io-images/run-java-sh[run-java.sh] is a generic startup script for starting Java application which can be influenced by various environment variables. It is also used in server images for seting container specific limits (e.g. memory limits).
* https://github.com/fabric8io/agent-bond[Agent Bond] is a super JVM agent which includes https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia[Jolokia] for accessing JMX information and https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[jmx_exporter] for exposing https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] metrics. These agents also can be enabled / disabled and configured with environment variables.

The following images are available. Please refer to their GitHub and DockerHub repos for more details and usage information.

[java-images]
== Java

The Java base image contain a generic shell startup script which startups Java application stored in a directory either as flat classpath application or as a fat jar.

[id='jetty-images']
== Jetty

The Jetty server images automatically deploy any wars found under a certain directory, `/deployments` by default. These images can be used either as base images for your application, or linked together with a data container during runtime. These images are based directly on https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/base-jdk/[jboss/base-jdk:8].
